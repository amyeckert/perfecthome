Find your perfect home! Or not...?

I love Mad Libs and the ridiculous language of real estate listings. Why not combine the two? 
A work in progress! 

This is an off-shoot of a larger effort called Manufacturing Home: a photography project exploring ideas about place, comfort, class and mobility through photographs of mass-market, factory-built homes in America. (current site: www.manufacturinghome.com, which I'm completely rebuilding. Eventually.)
