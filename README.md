Find your perfect home, Mad-Libs-style...

A work in progress!

This ultimately will be part of larger site called Manufacturing Home which is a photography project 
of mine that explores ideas about place, comfort, class and mobility 
through photographs of mass-market, factory-built homes in America:
Can you mass-produce a sense of home? Can you build it on an assembly line? 

The project includes essays by Lynne Tillman and Charles D'ambrosio, 
and was first published in Nest Magazine. 

(current site: www.manufacturinghome.com, which I'm completely overhauling eventually.)

 Stay tuned!
